# Developing a Simple Command Line Todo App

In this tutorial, we will create a simple command-line Todo application using TypeScript, Node.js, and the Inquirer library. This app will allow users to add, view, mark as done, and delete tasks in their todo list.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- A code editor of your choice (e.g., Visual Studio Code)

## Step 1: Project Setup

1. Create a new project folder for your Todo app.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project folder.

3. Initialize a new Node.js project by running:

   ```bash
   npm init -y
   npm install typescript inquirer
   import inquirer from 'inquirer'
  -Compile and Run
